## Notes
taken by `Rhyan`

- Dont memorize formulas, an engineer must design formulas
- An engineer must know when to utilize statistical tools such as mean, median, and mode
- Measure of central tendency knows the location or characteristic of most of the data `e.g. age`
- Engineers are *data-driven*
- Measure of spread : `standard deviation`
- Softwares to be used: [JMP](https://www.jmp.com/en_ph/software/data-analysis-software.html), [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), [Python](https://www.python.org)
- *Information Obesity* -  too much aborption of unnecessary information, thus analysis of data and information is crucial
				                  - Data must be processed
- Crunching the data gathered and getting the most from the data computed
